A simple, smooth and elegant Android File Manager with Material Design UI.
I started to develop this App as my first Android Project. I focalized mainly about two things:
- Material Design UI patterns;
- Providing a fast and responsive experience for the user.

It has also the most common functions as a File Explorer, like:
- Multiple files selection;
- Create new files or directories;
- Copy, Move, Delete, or Rename files or directories;
- Zip and Unzip files and directories;
- Global search of files and directories in the phone memory.

I think also that customization is a fundamental part of an Android App, so i've given the user the opportunity to change the drawer shortcut paths (to Images folder, Music folder, and Download folder).

UI Example:
